# About

## Who are you?
I'm a Jesus follower, husband, father, information security professional, and an all around geek. I love learning and am fascinated with technology. Despite my affinity for all things tech, I still manage to venture out to nature from time-to-time. Although it may seem I live and breath technology, let me assure you my relationship with Christ is far more important. In fact, it is what led me and my young family to leave a comfortable life and move to Chile. If this seems strange to you or you simply want to know more, please ask. I'd love to share with you as this could change your life.

## Whatâ€™s this site about?
I started this site as an outlet for me to share my thought and also give back to the tech community by documenting some of what I have learned, built, and discovered during my quest to learn more and experiment with different technologies. Professionally, I work as an Enterprise Security Engineer in the healthcare sector. While many of my posts and tutorials will certainly have a security aspect to them, the goal is for this blog to cover a wider range of IT topics. Of course, I weave security considerations in when it makes sense to do so. It's just who I am. Besides, everyone benefits when systems are appropriately secured.
