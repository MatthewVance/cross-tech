OpenPGP Key Transition Statement for Matthew Vance

I created a new OpenPGP key and am transitioning away from
my old key. The old key has not been compromised and will continue to
be valid for some time, but I prefer all future correspondence to be
encrypted to the new key. I also plan to make signatures with the new
key going forward.

I would like this new key to be re-integrated into the web of trust.
This message is signed by both keys to certify the transition. My new
and old keys are signed by each other. If you have signed my old key,
I would appreciate signatures on my new key as well, provided that
your signing policy permits this without re-authenticating me.

The old key is:
pub   2048R/0xB55BD4DD57A773EA 2010-05-07
      Key fingerprint = 0C3F C789 DA17 1BAF 40DD  937C B55B D4DD 57A7 73EA

The new key is:

pub   4096R/0x68953CC861A67E7D 2016-02-13
      Key fingerprint = 12E3 2FE5 0618 0D2E 48E1  D0B2 6895 3CC8 61A6 7E7D

The key is also available from: https://keybase.io/mvance

To fetch the full new key from a public key server using GnuPG, run:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 0x68953CC861A67E7D

If you already know my old key, you can verify the new key is
signed by the old one by running:

  gpg --check-sigs 0x68953CC861A67E7D

If you are satisfied you have the correct key, I would appreciate it if you
would sign my key:

  gpg --sign-key 0x68953CC861A67E7D

You can upload your signatures to a public keyserver directly:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --send-key 0x68953CC861A67E7D

Or email me (possibly encrypted) the output from:

  gpg --armor --export 0x68953CC861A67E7D

Please contact me directly if you would like any further verification or have
any questions about the transition.

To verify the integrity of this statement:

  wget -q -O- https://matthewvance.github.io/cross-tech/downloads/key-transition-2016-02-18.txt|gpg --verify
