I will go ahead and admit this site is &lt;em&gt;very much&lt;/em&gt; a work in progress. I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about publishing a personal website for quite a while now and keep hoping to have time to configure everything the way I want before launching the&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas though, I have come to the realization I am better off publishing something now and putting on the finishing touches on the site over the coming months. This will at least give me a platform to begin sharing helpful information with&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hile I do not like to make excuses, I think it is fair to say I have had other priorities than working on this blog. Indeed, life has been extra crazy this year. To give you an idea of just how crazy life has been for my&amp;nbsp;family:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have moved from Chile to the United&amp;nbsp;States;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started a new job (or rather returned to the employer I worked for prior to moving to Chile in&amp;nbsp;2012);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We purchased a&amp;nbsp;house;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had a&amp;nbsp;baby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And&amp;#8230;all that was within the first four months of this&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="life"></category></entry></feed>
