    <h1>About</h1>
<h2>Who are&nbsp;you?</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m a Jesus follower, husband, father, information security professional, and an all around geek. I love learning and am fascinated with technology. Despite my affinity for all things tech, I still manage to venture out to nature from time-to-time. Although it may seem I live and breath technology, let me assure you my relationship with Christ is far more important. In fact, it is what led me and my young family to leave a comfortable life and move to Chile. If this seems strange to you or you simply want to know more, please ask. I&#8217;d love to share with you as this could change your&nbsp;life.</p>
<h2>Whatâ€™s this site&nbsp;about?</h2>
<p>I started this site as an outlet for me to share my thought and also give back to the tech community by documenting some of what I have learned, built, and discovered during my quest to learn more and experiment with different technologies. Professionally, I work as an Enterprise Security Engineer in the healthcare sector. While many of my posts and tutorials will certainly have a security aspect to them, the goal is for this blog to cover a wider range of <span class="caps">IT</span> topics. Of course, I weave security considerations in when it makes sense to do so. It&#8217;s just who I am. Besides, everyone benefits when systems are appropriately&nbsp;secured.</p>
