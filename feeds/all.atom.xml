OpenPGP Key Transition Statement for Matthew Vance

I created a new OpenPGP key and am transitioning away from
my old key. The old key has not been compromised and will continue to
be valid for some time, but I prefer all future correspondence to be
encrypted to the new key. I also plan to make signatures with the new
key going forward.

I would like this new key to be re-integrated into the web of trust.
This message is signed by both keys to certify the transition. My new
and old keys are signed by each other. If you have signed my old key,
I would appreciate signatures on my new key as well, provided that
your signing policy permits this without re-authenticating me.

The old key is:
pub   2048R/0xB55BD4DD57A773EA 2010-05-07
      Key fingerprint = 0C3F C789 DA17 1BAF 40DD  937C B55B D4DD 57A7 73EA

The new key is:

pub   4096R/0x68953CC861A67E7D 2016-02-13
      Key fingerprint = 12E3 2FE5 0618 0D2E 48E1  D0B2 6895 3CC8 61A6 7E7D

The key is also available from: https://keybase.io/mvance

To fetch the full new key from a public key server using GnuPG, run:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key 0x68953CC861A67E7D

If you already know my old key, you can verify the new key is
signed by the old one by running:

  gpg --check-sigs 0x68953CC861A67E7D

If you are satisfied you have the correct key, I would appreciate it if you
would sign my key:

  gpg --sign-key 0x68953CC861A67E7D

You can upload your signatures to a public keyserver directly:

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --send-key 0x68953CC861A67E7D

Or email me (possibly encrypted) the output from:

  gpg --armor --export 0x68953CC861A67E7D

Please contact me directly if you would like any further verification or have
any questions about the transition.

To verify the integrity of this statement:

  wget -q -O- https://matthewvance.github.io/cross-tech/downloads/key-transition-2016-02-18.txt|gpg --verify

My recommendations for a home Linux server are below, but you can of course use alternatives to your liking/budget (the last two are completely optional&amp;nbsp;accessories).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A83I8G2?psc=1&amp;amp;redirect=true&amp;amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00"&gt;Apple 12W &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; Power Adapter&lt;/a&gt; - I like the Apple version because it&amp;#8217;s rated for 5.2 volts and 2.4 amps which is more than sufficient to support overclocking and any Pi accessories I may decide to add in the future. Also, when it comes to electrical stuff I&amp;#8217;d rather by a brand which should have some good quality control and safety measures in&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01273L37G?psc=1&amp;amp;redirect=true&amp;amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00"&gt;Samsung Pro Plus &lt;span class="caps"&gt;32GB&lt;/span&gt; MicroSDHC Memory Card with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;95MB&lt;/span&gt;/s Read, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;90MB&lt;/span&gt;/s Write&lt;/a&gt; - This card likely supports read/write speeds faster than the Pi is capable of reading/writing, but I got a great deal on at the time and don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about the card being a bottleneck. However, at the current price at the time of this post, I suggest you also look at the &lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B013CP5F90?psc=1&amp;amp;redirect=true&amp;amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00"&gt;SanDisk Extreme &lt;span class="caps"&gt;16GB&lt;/span&gt; microSDHC &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UHS&lt;/span&gt;-1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_6?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;amp;field-keywords=cat+5+cable&amp;amp;sprefix=cat+5+%2Caps%2C243&amp;amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Acat+5+cable"&gt;Inexpensive Ethernet Cable&lt;/a&gt; - I had a spare one in my parts bucket and any basic cable should do so I don&amp;#8217;t have a specific recommendation. A wireless &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; adapter is alternative option, but I prefer wired connections when&amp;nbsp;practical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;amp;field-keywords=micro-usb+cable"&gt;Micro-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; Cable&lt;/a&gt; - As with the Cat5 cable, I had a spare so I don&amp;#8217;t have a specific recommendation. If in doubt, the AmazonBasics brand should be a safe&amp;nbsp;choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_15?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;amp;field-keywords=raspberry+pi+heatsink&amp;amp;sprefix=raspberry+pi+heatsink%2Caps%2C147&amp;amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Araspberry+pi+heatsink"&gt;Inexpensive Heatsink Set&lt;/a&gt; - If you plan to overclock and keep this in an enclosed, fan-less case, a heatsink might help. I received some as a gift and am not sure of which brand I have. Any set with decent reviews online should meet your&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00MQLB1N6/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;colid=W77D6UZQZW9X&amp;amp;coliid=I7435U6HPZ8RO"&gt;Premium Clear Case for Raspberry Pi 2 Model B Quad Core and Raspberry Pi Model B+ (B &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLUS&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; - This is a matter of preference. I like the clear style and accessibility to all the ports and pins provided by this&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re new to the Pi like I was, I hope the above list will be a good starting point for acquiring the accessories needed for a home server&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Raspberry Pi"></category><category term="What I Use"></category></entry><entry><title>Pi Served: Raspberry Pi Series Announcement</title><link href="https://matthewvance.github.io/cross-tech/raspberry-pi-series.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-02-08T21:50:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Matthew Vance</name></author><id>tag:matthewvance.github.io,2016-02-06:cross-tech/raspberry-pi-series.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I received my first Raspberry Pi this past Christmas and have really enjoyed it.

&lt;li&gt;We have moved from Chile to the United&amp;nbsp;States;&lt;/li&gt;
