My recommendations for a home Linux server are below, but you can of course use alternatives to your liking/budget (the last two are completely optional&amp;nbsp;accessories).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A83I8G2?psc=1&amp;amp;redirect=true&amp;amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00"&gt;Apple 12W &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; Power Adapter&lt;/a&gt; - I like the Apple version because it&amp;#8217;s rated for 5.2 volts and 2.4 amps which is more than sufficient to support overclocking and any Pi accessories I may decide to add in the future. Also, when it comes to electrical stuff I&amp;#8217;d rather by a brand which should have some good quality control and safety measures in&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01273L37G?psc=1&amp;amp;redirect=true&amp;amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00"&gt;Samsung Pro Plus &lt;span class="caps"&gt;32GB&lt;/span&gt; MicroSDHC Memory Card with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;95MB&lt;/span&gt;/s Read, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;90MB&lt;/span&gt;/s Write&lt;/a&gt; - This card likely supports read/write speeds faster than the Pi is capable of reading/writing, but I got a great deal on at the time and don&amp;#8217;t have to worry about the card being a bottleneck. However, at the current price at the time of this post, I suggest you also look at the &lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B013CP5F90?psc=1&amp;amp;redirect=true&amp;amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00"&gt;SanDisk Extreme &lt;span class="caps"&gt;16GB&lt;/span&gt; microSDHC &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UHS&lt;/span&gt;-1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_6?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;amp;field-keywords=cat+5+cable&amp;amp;sprefix=cat+5+%2Caps%2C243&amp;amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Acat+5+cable"&gt;Inexpensive Ethernet Cable&lt;/a&gt; - I had a spare one in my parts bucket and any basic cable should do so I don&amp;#8217;t have a specific recommendation. A wireless &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; adapter is alternative option, but I prefer wired connections when&amp;nbsp;practical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;amp;field-keywords=micro-usb+cable"&gt;Micro-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USB&lt;/span&gt; Cable&lt;/a&gt; - As with the Cat5 cable, I had a spare so I don&amp;#8217;t have a specific recommendation. If in doubt, the AmazonBasics brand should be a safe&amp;nbsp;choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_c_0_15?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;amp;field-keywords=raspberry+pi+heatsink&amp;amp;sprefix=raspberry+pi+heatsink%2Caps%2C147&amp;amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Araspberry+pi+heatsink"&gt;Inexpensive Heatsink Set&lt;/a&gt; - If you plan to overclock and keep this in an enclosed, fan-less case, a heatsink might help. I received some as a gift and am not sure of which brand I have. Any set with decent reviews online should meet your&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00MQLB1N6/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;colid=W77D6UZQZW9X&amp;amp;coliid=I7435U6HPZ8RO"&gt;Premium Clear Case for Raspberry Pi 2 Model B Quad Core and Raspberry Pi Model B+ (B &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PLUS&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; - This is a matter of preference. I like the clear style and accessibility to all the ports and pins provided by this&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re new to the Pi like I was, I hope the above list will be a good starting point for acquiring the accessories needed for a home server&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Raspberry Pi"></category><category term="What I Use"></category></entry><entry><title>Pi Served: Raspberry Pi Series Announcement</title><link href="https://matthewvance.github.io/cross-tech/raspberry-pi-series.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-02-08T21:50:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Matthew Vance</name></author><id>tag:matthewvance.github.io,2016-02-06:cross-tech/raspberry-pi-series.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I received my first Raspberry Pi this past Christmas and have really enjoyed it. While I have not done any neat maker type things with it, I&amp;#8217;ve turned it into a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LEMP&lt;/span&gt; (Linux, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NGINX&lt;/span&gt;, MariaDB, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;) and network/resource monitoring server. As a way to give back to the community, I thought it would be good if I created a series to document the process. Being a security guy, I plan to give some security tips along the way. I plan to post the articles online as I complete&amp;nbsp;them. &lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Raspberry Pi"></category></entry><entry><title>Obligatory First Post</title><link href="https://matthewvance.github.io/cross-tech/fist-post.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-10-07T22:30:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Matthew Vance</name></author><id>tag:matthewvance.github.io,2015-10-07:cross-tech/fist-post.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every blog must have a first post so this one is it. I will go ahead and admit this site is &lt;em&gt;very much&lt;/em&gt; a work in progress. I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about publishing a personal website for quite a while now and keep hoping to have time to configure everything the way I want before launching the&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas though, I have come to the realization I am better off publishing something now and putting on the finishing touches on the site over the coming months. This will at least give me a platform to begin sharing helpful information with&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hile I do not like to make excuses, I think it is fair to say I have had other priorities than working on this blog. Indeed, life has been extra crazy this year. To give you an idea of just how crazy life has been for my&amp;nbsp;family:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have moved from Chile to the United&amp;nbsp;States;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I started a new job (or rather returned to the employer I worked for prior to moving to Chile in&amp;nbsp;2012);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We purchased a&amp;nbsp;house;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We had a&amp;nbsp;baby.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And&amp;#8230;all that was within the first four months of this&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="life"></category></entry></feed>
