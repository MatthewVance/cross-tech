I received my first Raspberry Pi this past Christmas and have really enjoyed it. While I have not done any neat maker type things with it, I've turned it into a LEMP (Linux, NGINX, MariaDB, and PHP) and network/resource monitoring server. As a way to give back to the community, I thought it would be good if I created a series to document the process. Being a security guy, I plan to give some security tips along the way.
